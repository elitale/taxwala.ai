## HOOK (First 10 Seconds)

Hi, I’m Dharmendra Soni.

And if you’re a business owner in India, let me ask you something.

Right now…  
are you **100% sure** your GST, TDS, and ITR filings are correct?

Or are you *hoping* nothing goes wrong this year?

---

## RELATABLE PAIN

A few months ago, that was me.

Running my business during the day…  
and spending nights and weekends stuck in tax work.

Bank statements.  
Receipts from WhatsApp.  
Excel sheets that never matched.

GST every month.  
ITR once a year.  
Form 26AS, TDS, advance tax… it just never ended.

And the worst part wasn’t the time.

It was the **constant fear**.

“Did I miss something?”  
“What if a notice comes?”  
“What if my CA made a mistake… or I did?”

---

## FAILED SOLUTIONS

I tried everything.

I hired accountants.  
They were knowledgeable, but slow.  
And every small question needed follow-ups.

I tried software tools.  
But most were built for the US —  
they didn’t understand Indian tax complexity.

And Excel?

Honestly… that just made things worse.

So even after spending money and time,  
I still wasn’t confident.

---

## TURNING POINT

That’s when I realized something.

The problem wasn’t effort.  
The problem was **manual work**.

Indian taxes don’t need more spreadsheets.  
They need automation — done correctly.

So I decided to build something for myself.

---

## INTRODUCING THE SOLUTION

That’s how **TaxWala.ai** was born.

An AI-powered tax filing system  
built specifically for Indian businesses.

Today, my tax filing doesn’t take hours.

It takes **less than 5 minutes**.

---

## HOW IT WORKS (SIMPLE & BELIEVABLE)

Here’s how it works.

**Step one:**  
Connect your bank account  
—or upload your bank statements.

**Step two:**  
If you file GST, upload your sales and expense receipts.  
Soon, you’ll be able to connect your POS directly.

That’s it.

No forms.  
No manual calculations.

---

## AI + HUMAN TRUST STACK

After that, our AI agents take over.

They read every transaction.  
Automatically categorize income and expenses.  
Calculate GST, TDS, advance tax, and ITR values.

For example —  
if a client pays you ₹1,25,000,  
the system knows whether TDS applies  
and treats it correctly in your return.

And here’s the most important part:

**Every filing is reviewed and approved by our in-house Chartered Accountants.**

So you get the **speed of AI**  
with the **safety of human expertise**.

Nothing is filed without accuracy.  
Nothing is submitted without review.

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

You might be wondering:

“Can AI really handle Indian taxes?”

That’s exactly why we don’t rely on AI alone.

AI does the heavy lifting.  
Qualified CAs ensure compliance.

Your data is encrypted.  
Your filings are accurate.  
And you always stay in control.

---

  our team will help you respond — at no extra cost.**

You’re never alone.

---

## BENEFITS (EMOTIONAL PAYOFF)

After that?

You’re done.

No stress before deadlines.  
No chasing your CA.  
No second-guessing your numbers.

You get back **20+ hours every month**.

Time you can use to grow your business…  
or simply switch off and breathe.

---
