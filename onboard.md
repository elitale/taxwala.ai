how auth screen should look like 

get inspire from the miro.com

simple onboarding with pop up where in the background they show the potetial screen what they could achieve and they will ones they will signup



first ask their email address and then the password and submit if the email exist match the password if correct let them in else throw error

if password does not exist then create the account and send email verification

and continue with onboarding question



auth 
    - with email and password

ask few onboarding questions
    phone number
    like where they are coming from?
    what are they individual / company
    simple record their voice or create input text what are suppose to achive here.
    many mor questions to fully understand them in the meanwhile
    track their ip to know the location
    also ask are they technical or non tech-technical
    professional
    linkedin or instagram accound


- if they are individual continue to dashboard and wait for email to be verified and allow email to be change to unique email if they are willing and say please verify your email address first or if incorrect change it because we will send important notifications on the email
